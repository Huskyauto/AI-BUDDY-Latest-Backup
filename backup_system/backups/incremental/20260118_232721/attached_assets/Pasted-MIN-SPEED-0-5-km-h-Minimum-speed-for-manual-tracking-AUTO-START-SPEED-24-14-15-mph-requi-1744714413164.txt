MIN_SPEED = 0.5 km/h // Minimum speed for manual tracking AUTO_START_SPEED = 24.14 // 15 mph - required for auto-start TRIGGER_SPEED = 16.1 // 10 mph - maximum for alerts
 
### Auto-Start Behavior
1. Manual Start/Stop Control
   - User can manually start/stop tracking at any time
   - Manual stop is respected until high-speed threshold is reached
   - `manuallyStoppedTracking` flag prevents unwanted auto-restart
 
2. Speed-Based Auto-Start Logic
   - Only activates after reaching 15 mph (24.14 km/h)
   - Requires sustained speed above threshold
   - Resets when manually stopped until high speed is reached again
 
3. State Management
   ```javascript
   isTrackingActive        // Current tracking state
   hasReachedAutoStartSpeed // High-speed threshold reached
   autoStartEnabled        // Auto-start capability enabled
   manuallyStoppedTracking // Manual stop override
Alert Timing
•	Minimum interval between alerts: 60 seconds
•	Extended cooldown for same restaurant: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
•	Automatic speed-based activation when speed drops below threshold
Voice Synthesis Configuration
utterance.rate = 0.9     // Slightly slower than default for clarity
utterance.pitch = 1.0    // Standard pitch
utterance.volume = 1.0   // Full volume
Configuration Parameters
Location Tracking
SEARCH_RADIUS = 100  # meters - closer range for better accuracy
ALERT_RADIUS = 50    # meters - smaller radius for precise alerts
SPEED_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # km/h - very low threshold for stationary detection
MIN_ACCURACY = 100    # meters (GPS accuracy threshold)
MIN_SPEED_COUNT = 2   # Minimum speed readings required
API Configuration
•	Blueprint URL prefix: '/location-wellness'
•	Required endpoints:
/api/test-api-key   # Test Google Maps API key
/api/test-places    # Test nearby places detection
/api/location-status # Update location and get alerts
Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Solutions
1.	Auto-Start Not Working
•	Verify speed threshold (24.14 km/h / 15 mph required)
•	Check if manually stopped (requires reaching high speed again)
•	Confirm GPS accuracy meets minimum threshold
•	Review console logs for speed monitoring status
2.	Unwanted Auto-Start
•	Check manuallyStoppedTracking flag
•	Verify speed calculations
•	Ensure proper state reset after manual stop
•	Review auto-start conditions in console logs
3.	API Test Failures
•	Verify correct blueprint URL prefix ('/location-wellness')
•	Check Google Maps API key configuration
•	Confirm endpoint accessibility
•	Review server response in developer console
4.	Location Alert Issues
•	Verify GPS accuracy meets minimum threshold
•	Check speed calculations
•	Confirm Places API response
•	Review location tracking status
•	Check alert cooldown periods
State Debugging
Console log format for speed monitoring:
{
    currentSpeed: "0.05",        // Current speed in km/h
    averageSpeed: "0.04",        // Average of recent readings
    hasReachedAutoStart: false,  // High-speed threshold status
    manuallyStoppedTracking: true // Manual stop override status
}
