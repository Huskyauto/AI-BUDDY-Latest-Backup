Here's a breakdown of the likely logic problems and why the fasting tracker isn't behaving as expected, based on the image and your description:

Core Problem: Incorrect Day Tracking

The primary issue is that the tracker displays "Day 0 of 0" and claims "Day 1 completed!" simultaneously. This indicates a fundamental flaw in how the app is handling the current day and total days of the fast.  It seems stuck in an initial or reset state.

Possible Causes and Logic Flaws:

Initialization Issue:

The currentDay variable (or whatever it's called internally) might not be properly initialized. It could be starting at 0, and the "Day 1 completed" message is triggered before the currentDay is incremented. A proper 5-day fast should have days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. A "Day 0" is conceptually incorrect during the fast (though it could represent a pre-fast preparation day). "Day 0 of 0" is doubly incorrect.
There might be an off-by-one error. The logic that increments the day might happen after the display logic, leading to the lag.
Increment Logic Error:

The function responsible for incrementing the currentDay might not be firing correctly. This is the most likely cause. It could be tied to a button press, a timer, or a specific time of day. The image shows no obvious "next day" button, so it's probably intended to be automatic. Possible reasons it's failing:
Missing Event Listener: If it's supposed to increment daily (e.g., at midnight), the event listener (the part of the code that waits for midnight) might be missing, incorrectly configured, or getting blocked.
Date/Time Calculation Error: The logic that determines if a new day has started could be faulty. It might be comparing timestamps incorrectly, not handling timezones properly, or not accounting for daylight saving time.
Conditional Logic Error: There might be a if statement (or similar conditional logic) that prevents the increment from happening. Perhaps it's checking for a condition that's never met.
No Local Storage, or failing local storage: To have it log every day, the data will likely be stored in some type of local storage on the device, it is possible this save is not happening.
Display Logic Error:

Even if the internal currentDay variable is (eventually) incrementing, the part of the code that displays the day might not be reading the correct value. It could be:
Reading a different variable.
Hardcoded to display "0".
Not updating after the currentDay changes (this is a "reactivity" problem in some UI frameworks).
"Reset Fast" Button Interference:

There's a "Reset Fast" button. It's possible that the reset function is being called inadvertently (perhaps on page load), constantly resetting the currentDay to 0. This is less likely, but a possible source of the issue. The logic of the button press is not clearing some other piece of data.
"Day 1 completed!" Premature Trigger

This message is very suspicious. It should only appear after Day 1 is truly complete (i.e., when currentDay should be 2). It is possible it is set to be true no matter what.
In Summary (Most Likely to Least Likely):

Increment Logic Error: The daily increment function is not firing or is failing. This is by far the most probable culprit. Check the event listener or timer that should trigger the increment.
Initialization Issue / Off-by-One Error: currentDay starts at 0 and isn't updated until after the initial display.
Display Logic Error: The UI isn't showing the correct currentDay value, even if it's changing internally.
"Reset Fast" interference, but this is probably not the problem.
How to Debug (If You Had Code Access):

Inspect Variables: Use debugging tools (like your browser's developer console) to inspect the values of currentDay, totalDays (if it exists), and any variables related to date/time.
Step Through Code: Use a debugger to step through the code line by line, especially the increment function and the display logic. This lets you see exactly what's happening at each step.
Console Logging: Add console.log() statements (or the equivalent in your language) to print the values of relevant variables at key points in the code. This helps you track how the variables change over time.
Check Local Storage: Use the developer console, to look at the local storage to verify if day information is being stored, and if it is being stored, what is actually being stored.
Test the Reset Function: Manually click the "Reset Fast" button and observe its behavior. Make sure it correctly resets the counter.
Isolate the Increment: Try to trigger the day increment function manually (e.g., from the console) to see if it works in isolation.
Check Network request: Check for any network errors, if, for example, the app uses an API to track the date.
By systematically investigating these areas, you could pinpoint the exact cause of the problem and fix the fasting tracker.
