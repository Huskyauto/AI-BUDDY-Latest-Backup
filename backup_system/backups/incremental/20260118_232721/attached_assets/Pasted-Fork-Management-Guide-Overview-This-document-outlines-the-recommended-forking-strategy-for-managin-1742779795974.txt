Fork Management Guide
Overview
This document outlines the recommended forking strategy for managing updates and preserving working versions of the AI-BUDDY application.
Daily Fork Strategy
Why Use Daily Forks?
1.	Isolation of Updates: Keep working versions separate from development versions
2.	Work Preservation: Maintain clean snapshots of working code
3.	Risk Management: Prevent loss of working code when making significant changes
4.	Version Control: Maintain a history of working versions
Best Practices
1.	Create Date-Based Forks
•	Name format: AI-BUDDY-YYYY-MM-DD
•	Create a new fork at the start of each development session
•	Use the Replit UI: Three dots menu (⋮) → "Create new fork"/"Create remix"
2.	Working with Forks
•	Always start new features/updates in the latest fork
•	Test changes thoroughly before creating the next fork
•	Keep the original working version untouched
3.	When to Create a New Fork
•	Before starting major new features
•	At the beginning of each development day
•	After achieving a stable, working version
Backup Considerations
The current backup system has limitations:
•	Backups can be overwritten during multiple edit attempts
•	Limited history retention
To mitigate these limitations:
1.	Create a new fork before making significant changes
2.	Test changes in the new fork first
3.	If changes don't work, create another fork from the last working version
Fork Management Process
1.	Starting New Development
# Create new fork through Replit UI
AI-BUDDY-YYYY-MM-DD
2.	Testing Changes
•	Make and test changes in the new fork
•	If successful, continue development
•	If unsuccessful, create a new fork from the last working version
3.	Preserving Working Versions
•	Keep successful forks as reference points
•	Document major changes in each fork's changelog
•	Use dated forks as restore points if needed
Tips for Success
1.	Always verify the new fork is working before making changes
2.	Document significant changes in the changelog
3.	Keep track of which fork contains the last working version
4.	Create new forks liberally - better to have too many backups than too few
5.	Test thoroughly before considering a fork as a "working version"
Future Improvements
•	Request for daily automatic forking capability in Replit
•	Better integration between forks and backup system
•	Automated fork cleanup and management tools
