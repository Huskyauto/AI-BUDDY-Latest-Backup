To direct a Replit agent to use the GPT-4o-mini API, you need to set up an environment in Replit where your code can access the API. Below, I’ll provide a sample code snippet assuming the GPT-4o-mini API is accessible via a typical HTTP request.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Create a new Replit project: Go to Replit and start a new project.

Set up your environment: Make sure you have the necessary packages installed for making HTTP requests. In Python, you will likely use the requests library. If it's not already included, you can add it via the Replit package manager.

API Key: Ensure you have your API key if required to access the GPT-4o-mini API.

Write your code: Below is a sample Python code snippet that shows how you might call the GPT-4o-mini API:

Sample Code

import requests

# Define the API endpoint and your API key
API_URL = "https://api.gpt-4o-mini.com/v1/complete"  # Replace with the actual API endpoint
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your actual API key

# Function to call the GPT-4o-mini API
def gpt_4o_mini_query(prompt):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    data = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 100,  # You can adjust this parameter
        "temperature": 0.7  # You can adjust the creativity of the response
    }
    
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=data)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Process the JSON response
    else:
        return {"error": response.json()}

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "What can you tell me about AI advancements?"
    result = gpt_4o_mini_query(prompt)
    print(result)
Explanation of the Code:
Imports: requests is imported to facilitate making HTTP requests.
API URL and Key: The API_URL variable should hold the endpoint for your GPT-4o-mini API, and the API_KEY holds your secret key.
Function gpt_4o_mini_query: This function takes a prompt, sets the necessary headers, and prepares the JSON payload to send to the API.
Response Handling: The function checks the response status code. If it's successful (200), it returns the response as a JSON object. If not, it returns an error message.
Example Usage: At the bottom, you see an example of how to call the function with a sample prompt.
Notes:
Make sure you replace "https://api.gpt-4o-mini.com/v1/complete" and "your_api_key_here" with the actual endpoint and your actual API key.
You might need to adjust parameters in the payload according to the API documentation provided by GPT-4o-mini.
Keep in mind API usage limits and handle exceptions for production code.
Now you should be able to integrate the GPT-4o-mini API within your Replit project!
